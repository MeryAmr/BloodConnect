### 1.4 Document Overview
This SRS is structured to provide an overview of BloodConnect, its functionality,
and the requirements necessary for its development and implementation. Specific details on system architecture,
user interactions, and design considerations are outlined in subsequent sections.

## 2. Overall Description
  
### 2.1 Product Perspective
#### Problem:
- Access to blood for medical emergencies and surgeries is often challenging due to inadequate communication between donors and recipients. This results in critical delays that can endanger lives. Current systems lack an efficient platform where individuals can easily request or donate blood, often requiring time-consuming manual processes or dependence on local blood banks with limited resources.  
The proposed platform aims to bridge this gap by providing an accessible, user-friendly solution for facilitating blood donations. It ensures that blood recipients can connect with donors promptly while adhering to essential medical and regulatory guidelines.

#### Solution:
- Itâ€™s a platform designed to bridge the gap between those in urgent need of blood and willing donors. In critical medical situations, such as surgeries, emergencies, and life-threatening conditions, finding the right blood type in time can be a matter of life or death. Blood Connect provides an intuitive and reliable interface to facilitate blood requests, manage donor profiles, and streamline the process of connecting recipients with nearby eligible donors.
- The platform allows users to create blood requests, specifying blood type and location, while enabling donors to view requests in their area and schedule donation appointments. With search and filter options, users can find compatible donors, blood banks, and hospitals with ease.

### 2.2 Product Features
Product features include:
- User signing up for the site.
- User choosing either to become a donor or to request blood.
- Identifying nearby hospitals or blood banks via map integration.
- Communication with said hospitals and blood banks.
- Ability to search for the blood type the user needs via search bar.
### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
**Donors**: They will donate blood to either blood banks or hospitals through our platform.
**Recipients/Requesters**: People who create urgent blood requests.
**Hospitals/BloodBanks**: Institutions who will manage blood requests, and communicate with our platform to check the requests of users or accept donations of donors.  
**Admins**: Developers and admins who will manage our website.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
**Web Platform:** Compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).  
**Mobile Platform:** Applications for Android and iOS devices

### 2.5 Constraints
Adherence to medical guidelines and local egyptian regulations for blood donation.
