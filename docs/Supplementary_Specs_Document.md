# Supplementary Specs Document


## 1. Purpose
This document outlines additional system requirements not covered by the functional requirements, providing clarity on system behaviors, constraints, and limitations.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements
These are quality attributes that describe how the system should perform and behave in specific areas:

### Usability
- The system should be intuitive and easy to navigate for users with varying IT literacy levels
- The interface should support accessibility features for people with disabilities, including:
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - High-contrast modes
  - Keyboard shortcuts

### Scalability
- The system must support a growing number of users and data without significant performance degradation

### Compatibility
- The system should be compatible with major modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and mobile devices (iOS and Android)
- It should work with different screen resolutions, including:
  - Desktops
  - Tablets
  - Smartphones

### Performance
- The system should have a response time of under 2 seconds for any user interaction
- It should be able to handle:
  - Minimum of 1,000 concurrent users
  - 50% increase in user load annually without performance issues

### Security
- User data should be encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., AES-256)
- Secure authentication methods (such as two-factor authentication) should be implemented

### Efficiency
- Resource Optimization: The system must be optimized to operate efficiently on cloud-based infrastructure to minimize resource consumption

### Support and Maintenance
- Service Levels: Provide 24/7 technical support with a response time of less than 1 hour for critical issues
- Updates: Conduct regular maintenance and updates every quarter to ensure system reliability and security

### Analytics and Reporting
- Performance Metrics: The system must include analytics tools to track user engagement, service quality, and operational performance
- Reports: Allow staff to generate detailed reports tailored to specific needs

## 3. Assumptions
- Users will have a stable internet connection to access and interact with the platform
- Users will be familiar with basic web navigation like signing up, creating requests, and browsing available blood donations
- All users will be registered with their valid blood type and medical information, ensuring a smooth matching process for blood requests and donations
- The platform will not be responsible for verifying the medical eligibility of donors, assuming this is handled by medical authorities

## 4. Limitations
### Medical Verification
The platform does not offer medical verification of blood donors or recipients. It will only provide a matching service based on blood type and location, with the understanding that the final medical check is done by healthcare providers.

### Geographic Limitations
The platform is limited to specific geographic regions. The availability of blood donations and requests is dependent on local blood banks and donation centers, which may have regional restrictions.
